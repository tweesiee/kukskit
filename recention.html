<h3>Lore.<br></h3>
<p>Journey's story is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes.<br>
The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert.<br> 
In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak.<br> 
As the character approaches the mountain,<br> 
they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time.<br> 
Scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests;<br> 
these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger,<br>
white-robed figure in a circular room,<br> 
with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey.<br>
The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization,<br>
and which still roam the city looking for intruders.</p>
